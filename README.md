flurryer-icons
==============

Icon theme inspired in a mix between Numix, Pacifica, iPhonica and elFaenza icon themes.

All icons except the base ones are retina-ready and non-optimized (yet) for lower resolutions.

The psd's are only for the icons that can be, and probably will, be improved, and the sources
used on those are available on the srcs folder.

Feel free to contact me for requests or contributing. Contributions will be very appreciated and credited.

The base.psd is the "template" for this icon set, that can have 4 flavours: disk, bezel, Cs, normal.

The Original Flurry icons are a creation of IconFactory.

SOON I will be publishing here links for an iContainer, IconPackage and maybe a Ubuntu PPA.
