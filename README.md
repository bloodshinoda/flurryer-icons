flurryer-icons
==============

Icon theme inspired in a mix between Numix, Pacifica, iPhonica and elFaenza icon themes.

The base icons will be added when I finish my TODO list of icons first, because is easier to me to
convert all the icons at the same time.

All icons except the base ones are retina-ready and non-optimized (yet) for lower resolutions.

The psd's are only for the icons that can be, and probably will, be improved, and the sources
used on those are available on the srcs folder.

Feel free to contact me for requests or contributing. Contributions will be very appreciated and credited.

The base.psd is the "template" for this icon set, that can have 5 flavours: disk, bezel, Cs, blocky and normal.

The Original Flurry icons are a creation of IconFactory.

SOON I will be publishing here links for an iContainer, IconPackage and maybe a Ubuntu PPA.
